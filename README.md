Distance Based Point Clustering
============


##Mean nearest neighbor distance statistic
First steps:
  1. Build distance matrix
  2. Calculate nearest neighbors by finding MIN of each axis 
  3. Find average of nearest neighbors
  4. Generate random points matrix (same total number)
  5. Find average nearest neighbor distance
  6. Compare averages
  7. Implement different distance functions
